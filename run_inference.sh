PROMPT = "Hyper-realistic basketball game scene on an indoor hardwood court under bright stadium lights, focusing on a close-up of two players in motion. One player, wearing a red and white jersey with the number 23, dribbles the orange basketball rapidly, sweat glistening on his forehead, as he moves toward the hoop. The opponent, in a blue and white jersey with the number 7, intensely defends, reaching out to block. The scene captures the intense expressions on their faces, the detailed textures of their uniforms, and the reflective surface of the polished wooden floor. In the background, a blurred crowd of cheering spectators, with some holding signs, adds depth and excitement. The camera follows the dribbling player's movement from a low angle, emphasizing the speed and agility of the action. Motion blur is applied to the fast-moving basketball, while the players' bodies remain sharp and detailed, showing every muscle movement and fabric wrinkle. The scene is lit with high-definition HDR lighting, capturing the gleam of the basketball hoop's net and the shadows cast by the players' rapid movements. The final frame focuses on the player in red jumping to shoot, with the ball leaving his fingertips, and the shot clock ticking down in the corner of the frame."
